# About Me

Hi! I'm _weinibuliu_. You can call me _BuLiu_ (In Chinese, it is written as "不留" and means never stand still) or just _Kade_.

I'm from China and currently based in Beijing.

My current learning focus is on the following technologies:

- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- C++

I absolutely love coding and am an avid contributor of the open-source community. I'm thrilled to meet fellow developers and can't wait to connect and create something amazing together!
